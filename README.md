### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Amanda and I'm from Brazil. I've been working as Front-End Developer since 2020 at DinariPay and I'm currently learning more about technologies such as php and laravel to become a fullstack developer (: Apart from that, I'm constantly learning new features of javascript besides digging in frameworks such as react.js and vue.js.
